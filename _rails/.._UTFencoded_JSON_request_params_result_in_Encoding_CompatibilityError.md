title: 3.0.20: UTF8-encoded JSON request params result in Encoding::CompatibilityError
labels: actionpack

I encountered a regression with the recent 3.0.20 release (and its switch to OkJson). The following HTTP call works on .19 and is broken on .20 as well as the current 3-0-stable branch:

```
curl "http://localhost:3000" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d "{\"value\":\"bÃ¤\"}"
```

The exception thrown on 3.0.20:

**Encoding::CompatibilityError (incompatible character encodings: UTF-8 and ASCII-8BIT)**

```
activesupport/lib/active_support/json/backends/okjson.rb:331:in `[]='
activesupport/lib/active_support/json/backends/okjson.rb:331:in `unquote'
activesupport/lib/active_support/json/backends/okjson.rb:251:in `strtok'
activesupport/lib/active_support/json/backends/okjson.rb:215:in `tok'
activesupport/lib/active_support/json/backends/okjson.rb:178:in `lex'
activesupport/lib/active_support/json/backends/okjson.rb:46:in `decode'
activesupport/lib/active_support/json/backends/okjson.rb:613:in `decode'
activesupport/lib/active_support/json/decoding.rb:14:in `decode'
actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/params_parser.rb:48:in `parse_formatted_parameters'
actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/params_parser.rb:17:in `call'
```

This seems to happen since the parameter is taken as ASCII-8BIT, and in [active_support/json/backends/okjson.rb line 271](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/3-0-stable/activesupport/lib/active_support/json/backends/okjson.rb#L271) the output string is converted to UTF-8 (but not the input string):

``` ruby
# In ruby >= 1.9, a[w] is a codepoint, not a byte.
if a.class.method_defined?(:force_encoding)
  a.force_encoding('UTF-8')
  rubydoesenc = true
end
```

This can be fixed by either doing force_encoding on the "q" input string as well, or using a different JSON backend.

I'm not sure whether the conversion to UTF-8 should happen in a different place, but 3.2's multi_json also seems to expect the JSON backend handling ASCII-BIT8 strings.
