title: [4.1.0.beta1] Time travel helpers don't work "out of the box"
labels: activesupport
layout: issue
---

Introduced by #12824 

I expect `travel` and `travel_to` to work on a fresh Rails application. Currently they depend on `mocha`, which is not a dependency for `rails`. We can:
1. make it a dependency
2. make it an optional dependency, warn when it's not there and show instructions on how to activate it.
3. ship a custom mocking implementation not built on top of mocha
4. depend on Timecop
