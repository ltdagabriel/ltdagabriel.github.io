title: Association Guide use Order as example, which is already used.

The association guide, http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html use the Order class as an example for expressing most association information.

However, that name conflicts with the 'order' scoping directive meaning that it is harder than necessary to search the guide for how to set up a default ordering.

Noticed when upgrading to 4.x and looking for the correct ordering syntax.
