title: 5.1.0.rc2, db:migrate:up and db:migrate:down no longer give proper errors

`db:migrate:up` or `db:migrate:down` both require a `VERSION` ENV arg. There is code that seems meant to `raise "VERSION is required"` if it is missing. 

However, due to #28485 swapping the order of two lines, apparently in an attempt to fix a different problem, the `raise` is not triggered on a missing `ENV['VERSION']` _only_ on one that is non-nil but `empty?`

So instead of getting a simple "VERSION is required" message, it passes `nil` into the depths of ActiveRecord code, and you end up with a:

```
ActiveRecord::UnknownMigrationVersionError:

Unknown migration version.
```

There's supposed to be a version listed after that colon at the end of the first line, but it's nil. 

To reproduce, just run `./bin/rails db:migrate:down`, without a `VERSION` arg, (or up, or with rake) in any rails 5.1.0.rc2 project. 

The fix in #28485 broke it worse.
