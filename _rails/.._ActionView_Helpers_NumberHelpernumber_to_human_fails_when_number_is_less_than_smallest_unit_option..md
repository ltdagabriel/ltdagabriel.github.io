title: 3.2.12 ActionView::Helpers::NumberHelper#number_to_human fails when number is less than smallest unit option.
labels: actionview
layout: issue
---

### Details

`number_to_human` raises a `TypeError` when the following conditions are met:
- A `:units` hash is provided.

and either
- The units hash is empty (i.e. `:units => {}`)

or
- The number provided is smaller than the smallest unit specified.

In both of these cases, I would expect the method to return the number unaltered (modulo the other options).

Instead, in both of these cases, you get the following trace:

```
TypeError: can't convert nil into String
    .../gems/actionpack-3.2.12/lib/action_view/helpers/number_helper.rb:603:in `gsub'
    .../gems/actionpack3.2.12/lib/action_view/helpers/number_helper.rb:603:in `number_to_human'
```
### Examples

```
> helper.number_to_human(100000)
 => "100 Thousand" 
> helper.number_to_human(100000, :units => {})
  [ERROR], expected: "100000"
 => "100" 
> helper.number_to_human(100000, :units => {:thousand => 'k'})
 => "100 k" 
> helper.number_to_human(1000, :units => {:thousand => 'k'})
 => "1 k" 
> helper.number_to_human(999, :units => {:thousand => 'k'})
  [ERROR], expected: "999"
> helper.number_to_human(999.9, :units => {:thousand => 'k'})
  [ERROR], expected: "999.9"
> helper.number_to_human(999, :units => {:ten => 'tens'})
 => "99.9 tens" 
> helper.number_to_human(9, :units => {:ten => 'tens'})
  [ERROR], expected: "9"
```
### Use Case

I can see an argument for not covering the empty hash case, but the second case is a common one when, e.g., displaying follower counts for a social application. One wants large numbers to be abbreviated, but short ones left alone. The current state of the method requires conditionalizing on the size of the number to achieve this.

_NB: I got these results using Ruby 1.8.7 and have not yet tried later Rubies._
