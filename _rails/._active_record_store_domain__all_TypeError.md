title: 3.1 active_record_store "domain: :all" TypeError
labels: actionpack
layout: issue

**update:** see the [comment below](#issuecomment-1956547) for a clean 3.1 app with the same error.

See [Pow issue #199](https://github.com/37signals/pow/issues/199)

Basically I keep getting a `can't convert Symbol into String` error when I change the `domain` for `session_store` to `:all`.
