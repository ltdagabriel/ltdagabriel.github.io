title: 5.0.0.rc1: Regression: Unable swap to a custom connection pool and back to AR::Base pool after #24844
labels: With reproduction steps, activerecord, regression
layout: issue

### Steps to reproduce

See [the failing AR test case and output](https://gist.github.com/jrafanie/a27f713e791875a45a007aebb013e539#file-test_for_swapping_connection_pools-diff-L31).  I wasn't sure where the fix/test for this should live but I believe the test case is valid in terms of testing how `remove_connection` should undo what `establish_connection` does.
### Expected behavior

`klass2.remove_connection` should remove any custom connection pool and allow the superclass's pool to be used by resetting caches/ivars indicating a custom pool is to be used.
### Actual behavior
#24844's refactoring changed behavior when you configure a custom connection and remove it.  Any subsequent calls to `connection` from that model will fail to find a pool and NOT fallback to the superclass' pool.

``` ruby
klass2.establish_connection(custom_config)
# code
klass2.remove_connection
klass2.connection  # raises ActiveRecord::ConnectionNotEstablished: No connection pool with id klass2 found
```
#### Workaround 1

``` ruby
klass2.establish_connection(custom_config)
# code
klass2.remove_connection
klass2.connection_specification_name = "primary" # this gets us back the primary pool
klass2.connection
```
#### Workaround 2

``` ruby
klass2.establish_connection(custom_config)
# code
klass2.remove_connection
klass2.establish_connection # this gets us back the primary pool
klass2.connection
```

Neither of these changes were needed prior to #24844.
### System configuration
