title: Asset pipeline: locally precompiled md5 fingerprints don't match with the ones generated by rails helpers in production (rails 3.1 rc6, ruby 1.9.2)

I precompile assets using rake assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=production locally on my development machine.

The problem is the generated md5 fingerprints in the precompiled filenames don't match the ones generated by the rails helpers (like asset_path) in production.

Any clues why this is?

I'm on Heroku, so precompiling on the server is no option, as they have a read only file system.
