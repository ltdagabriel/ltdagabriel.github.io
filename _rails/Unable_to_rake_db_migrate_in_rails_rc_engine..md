We have a rails engine and when we moved to rc2, we are unable to rebuild our database.

Here is a [gist](https://gist.github.com/KevinColemanInc/4fc0430e5bfdecb992b7) of my console when I try to recreate my db.

For the sake of brevity, I cropped the list of pending migrations, but all of their names are unique.
