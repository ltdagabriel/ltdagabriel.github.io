title: 127.0.0.1 not accessible when rails binds to localhost
labels: docs

I'm finding the statement in http://guides.rubyonrails.org/4_2_release_notes.html#default-host-for-rails-server that both 127.0.0.1 and localhost will work the same to be not true.

When left to the default rails settings in 4.2.0, localhost:3000 works fine, but 127.0.0.1:3000 does not. No matter the browser, or curl, I get: `curl: (7) Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 3000: Connection refused` when `Rails 4.2.0 application starting in development on http://localhost:3000`.

I'm not sure if the statement in the guide is just a mistake, or if there is more going on here. I'm developing on Mac OS X 10.10.3, with Ruby 2.2.2 and Rails 4.2.0.
