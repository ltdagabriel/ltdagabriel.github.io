title: [4.2.*] Calling #dup on a model using serialized attributes causes troubles
labels: activerecord, attached PR
layout: issue
---

I am using `serialize` to set complex attributes for my models. While upgrading my application from Rails 4.1 to 4.2, I had failing tests which I could track down to the call of `#dub`. This doesn't seem to be an issue with Rails <=4.1 and =5.0. 
### Steps to reproduce

See this [gist](https://gist.github.com/lacco/9a22c0be0c6ce18787bc6ada6cca39f9#file-rails_dup_test-rb).

```
class NamesSerializer
  def self.load(data)
    data.present? ? ActiveRecord::Coders::JSON.load(data) : ["A Name"]
  end

  def self.dump(names)
    ActiveRecord::Coders::JSON.dump(names)
  end
end

class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  serialize :names, NamesSerializer
end

class BugTest < Minitest::Test
  def test_dup
    assert_equal 'A Name', Product.new.names.first

    # Uncommenting this line or replacing #dup with #clone makes the test green
    Product.new.dup

    Product.new.names.first.replace('Just Another Name')

    assert_equal 'A Name', Product.new.names.first
  end
end
```
### Expected behavior

Calling `#dup` should not change the default value for `serialize`d attributes. In fact, from then on `serialize`d attributes are returning the **same** objects.
### Actual behavior

Calling `#dup` changes the default value for `serialize`d attributes.
### System configuration

**Rails version**: 4.2.7
**Ruby version**: 2.3.0

I am willing to dig deeper into this topic, but I have no idea how to start debugging with it.
